This project was created for the build week in my second unit of instruction at Lambda School.

I was only able to achieve 83% accuracy using Scikit-Learn's RandomForestClassifier. Making the web app and deploying to Heroku was the most challenging part of the project. Working on it gave me a great introduction to using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which was easier to get started with than I imagined.

Check out the [deployed app](https://syllables.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku for a description of the process.

The [github repo](https://github.com/jcs-lambda/unit2-syllables) contains the code, model, and training data.
