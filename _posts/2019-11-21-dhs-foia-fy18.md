The United States Department of Homeland Security publishes [several reports](https://www.dhs.gov/foia-annual-reports) to provide insight into their repsonses to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act. This is a quick look at how those numbers convey the current status of their work in this area.

In the executive summary of the [2018 Freedom of Information Act Report to the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the Office of Government Information Services](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs_fy2018_foia_report_updated.pdf), it is stated that one of the focus points of their efforts in the 2018 fiscal year was to reduce their backlog of open requests. I will try to see if this data contains any indication of that being the case.

This graph shows that most of the agencies whose data I examined closed over half of the requests they worked on throughout the 2018 fiscal year. In fact, almost half of the agencies managed to close out around 80% of their requests.

The next set of charts is a breakdown of the current status of cases by year they were initially requested for each agency I looked at. Based on the chart above, we should see more 'Closed' requests (in red) than 'Open' requests (in blue); and these charts validate that assumption. If DHS's focus on reducing the backlog of requests had any effect, we should see some indication of that in the years preceeding 2018.
