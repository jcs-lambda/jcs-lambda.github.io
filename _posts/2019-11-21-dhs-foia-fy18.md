The United States Department of Homeland Security publishes [several reports](https://www.dhs.gov/foia-annual-reports) to provide insight into their repsonses to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act. This is a quick look at how those numbers convey the current status of their work in this area.

In the executive summary of the [2018 Freedom of Information Act Report to the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the Office of Government Information Services](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs_fy2018_foia_report_updated.pdf), it is stated that one of the focus points of their efforts in the 2018 fiscal year was to reduce their backlog of open requests. I will try to see if this data contains any indication of that being the case.

![DHS FOIA FY18 Case Status Percentages by Agency](https://github.com/jcs-lambda/lambda-unit1-dhs-foia-fy18/raw/master/DHS_FOIA_FY18_CaseStatusPercentagesByAgency.png){: .center-block :}

This graph shows that most of the agencies whose data I examined closed over half of the requests they worked on throughout the 2018 fiscal year. In fact, almost half of the agencies managed to close out around 80% or more of their requests.

The next set of charts is a breakdown of the current status of cases by year they were initially requested for each agency I looked at. Based on the chart above, we should see more 'Closed' requests (in red) than 'Open' requests (in blue); and these charts validate that assumption. If DHS's focus on reducing the backlog of requests had any effect, we should see some indication of that in the years preceeding 2018.

I had hoped to see a strong indication of focused effort on closing out backlogged requests. The charts didn't represent that to me, so I ran a chi-squared hypothesis test to see if a request's current status had any relationship to being a backlogged request. The results showed a definite dependence between the request status and whether it was a backlogged request, but the data needs further analysis to determine what that dependence is based on.

My analysis did not dive into the final disposition of closed requests. They could have been granted, denied, or denied in part. Denials could have been for several different reasons. If you would like to explore it further, I stored a copy of the full spreadsheets in [this github repository](https://github.com/jcs-lambda/lambda-unit1-dhs-foia-fy18). Alternatively, you could jump right into the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jcs-lambda/lambda-unit1-dhs-foia-fy18/blob/master/jcs_DS10_Unit1_DataStorytelling.ipynb) and see what insights you can find.
